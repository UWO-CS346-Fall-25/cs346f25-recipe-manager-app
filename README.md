# Notes on current pages / features:

I centered the tagline in the website to make it more uniform with the
content itself. I also ensured that all inputs are associated with a label, as well as
giving the form's submit button the attribute: type="submit".

-Also updated the general styling to reflect a notebook look in the website.
-Changed some of the coloring to make it less harsh to look at.
-Added borders to certain elements to add more dimension to the page

Note: my-recipes page is still not implemented, but it will be when the database is integrated as
      the page relies heavily on it being present.
